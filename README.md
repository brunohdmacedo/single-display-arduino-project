# Display (Output) Arduino Project

This is a simple project in Arduino that uses 
the breadboard, the microcontroller, 
a 7-segment display and basic programming.

## The Arduino UNO Board
The Arduino UNO Board is the basic board
for beginners doing project in Arduino.

As from the previuos project, without
microcontroller, you're only control is 
through an external switch. And you
are just limited to that.

The microcontroller will enable you to
program electronic components so that you
can build digital devices that you want
to build.

### The Digital Pins
The digital pins are the very first to be 
encountered because they can be used by
components in several ways.

### The GND
The GND is the floating ground to complete
the circuit. Remember, in electrical setup
the earth ground is used extensively. 

## The BreadBoard
Breadboards are convenience for you to
simply put things in place. Plus,
it provides connections either horizontally
or vertically for further ease. Because
of this, you avoid overlapping wires:
the metal strip at the bottom of a breadboard
will do the job.
